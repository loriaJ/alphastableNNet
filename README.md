The functions to replicate the simulations are in the files: 
- `example_1D.R`, and
- `example_2D.R`.

These are used several times, using bash calls, to perform the simulations shown in the preprint.

The main functions to run the prediction are in: `qmat_functions.R`. Specifically, the main function to use is: `sample_2d`. This function takes 3 required parameters:

- `x`: the observed locations matrix,
- `y`: the observed responses,
- `xstar`: the locations for predictions,
 
It can also receive the optionals parameters: 
- `sigma2`: the assumed variance, predefined to be 1,
- `alpha0`: the index parameter of the $\alpha$-stables,
- `known_sigma`: if the assumed variance is given by the `sigma2` parameter,
- `nu`: scale of the $\alpha$-stable variables,
- `n_sim`: the number of simulations, predefined to be 1000,
- `return_qs_only`: boolean to identify if the function should compute the partitions and their probabilities only or if it should perform the complete inference process, false by default,
- `q_list_lambda`: by default an empty list, used to separate the procedure in two parts: obtaining the partitions and their respective probabilities, and the Markov chain Monte Carlo process which depends on the empty list.

We include the main examples used in the paper in the files `example_1D.R` and `example_2D.R` for one and two dimensions. The results using the air quality data from York, are in the folder `york_air_quality`. There are three scripts to run the python code: `pytorch_1d.py`, `pytorch_2d.py`, and `tubes_torch.py`; these need the locations on line 13, as a directory location (e.g. `/usr/location/alphastableNNet/`, but their output is already in the repository.

To obtain the Table 1 of the paper, you can simply run the script `./york_air_quality/compare_validation_results.R`. To obtain the `` `.RData` file used for that script, run the `./york_air_quality/samps_valid_tubes.R`, which uses output (i.e., $q_\ell$ and $\Lambda$) from the file `./york_air_quality/splits_valid_tubes.R`.
